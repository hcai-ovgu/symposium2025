# Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence Symposium (HCAI@OVGU 2025)

The emerging concept of **Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence** (HCAI) involves *amplifying*, *augmentation*, *empowering* and *enhancing* individuals. HCAI aims to ensure that AI systems operate transparently, deliver fair and equitable outcomes, and respect privacy while preserving human control. This approach involves multiple stakeholders, such as researchers, developers, business leaders, policymakers, and users, who are affected in various ways by implementing and evaluating AI systems.

The **Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence Symposium Series** (HCAI@OVGU) aims to bring together leading experts, from both academia and industry, who will be invited to provide keynotes about trending and innovative HCAI-related topics, such as Responsible AI, Explainable AI, Fairness, Legal AI, Adaptive and Personalised User Interfaces, Information Ethics, and many more.

HCAI@OVGU is intended to take place once a semester for one or two days at the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.inf.ovgu.de/en/) of the [Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg (OVGU)](https://www.ovgu.de/en/), and is organised by the [Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence Research Group](https://hcai.ovgu.de/).

The 2025 edition of the Symposium, HCAI@OVGU 2025, will be held in 2025 (dates to be announced).
